## Current Progress
- Implemented core wallet management with create/import/list functionality
- Implemented transaction management with send/get/estimate capabilities
- Added transaction history with block range filtering
- Added real-time transaction monitoring via WebSocket
- Added gas price optimization with EIP-1559 support
- Implemented complete contract interaction with ABI support
- Added contract deployment, method calls, event listening, and state management
- Created comprehensive contract validation utilities
- Basic server setup with FastMCP integration
- Environment configuration with dotenv

## Next Steps
1. Complete Phase 1 remaining tasks (error handling, validation, formatting)
2. Add comprehensive test coverage for all modules
3. Begin Phase 4 with token management
4. Add WebSocket connection management
5. Add transaction monitoring persistence
6. Implement proper logging and monitoring

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for each manager class
2. Integration tests for MCP endpoints
3. End-to-end tests for common workflows
4. Security tests for sensitive operations
5. Performance tests for batch operations
6. WebSocket connection tests

## Security Considerations
1. Private key storage in memory only
2. Input validation for all parameters
3. Rate limiting for API endpoints
4. API key authentication
5. Error message sanitization
6. Gas limit validation
7. Nonce management
8. Transaction signing security
9. WebSocket connection security
10. Transaction monitoring rate limiting

## Performance Optimizations
1. Connection pooling for Web3
2. Caching for frequently accessed data
3. Batch operations for multiple requests
4. Async operations where possible
5. Gas price optimization
6. Nonce management optimization
7. Transaction history pagination
8. WebSocket connection pooling
9. Block range optimization for history
10. Transaction monitoring batching
